# Brief #<N> <title>

Branch `issue/<N>-<slug>` from `<integration branch>` · worktree `.worktrees/issue-<N>` · model `<provider/model>`

**Goal**: <!-- one or two sentences -->

**Read first**: <!-- files and functions, in order -->

**Steps**: <!-- exactly what to write: functions, files, signatures -->

**Done when**: <!-- observable criteria -->

**Checks**:
```bash
# lint and the tests of the files touched
```

<!-- Optional: use Parts instead of the single-session Steps/Done when/Checks above when the work exceeds the
     per-session limit of 3 source files and 1 test file. Each part is one session and must fit that limit. -->
## Parts (optional)

<!-- The coordinator alone creates PRs. Default: one PR against the named integration branch after the final part.
     If the coordinator should create/update a PR after each part, say so explicitly; each intermediate PR starts
     with `Part of #<N>` and names what remains. -->
**Pull request timing (coordinator)**: <!-- after the final part | after each part -->

### Part A — <short title>
**Steps**: <!-- exact work and files; max 3 source files + 1 test file in this session -->
**Done when**: <!-- observable criteria for this part -->
**Checks**:
```bash
# this part's lint and tests
```

### Part B — <short title>
**Steps**: <!-- exact work and files; max 3 source files + 1 test file in this session -->
**Done when**: <!-- observable criteria for this part -->
**Checks**:
```bash
# this part's lint and tests
```

Follow the pull request timing above. After your assigned part, push the issue branch and return the filled
`.bive/templates/report.md` to the coordinator in your final response. The coordinator creates or updates the PR;
its body starts with `Closes #<N>` when complete, or `Part of #<N>` and what remains. If the coordinator must read
the report from another machine/session, include it in the body of the final pushed commit; the coordinator fills in
that commit's SHA. Do not rely on an ignored `.bive/state/` file for cross-machine transfer.
